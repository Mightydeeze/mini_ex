"But as I argue in my book, Waiting for Word, we are looking at waiting entirely wrong. Waiting isnâ€™t essentially a wasted in-between time; instead waiting is a core part of messages we send each other across the fiber optic lines. The time it takes to receive and interpret a message is also part of its content. We take the moment of waiting and give it meaning; it becomes a message of its own."
