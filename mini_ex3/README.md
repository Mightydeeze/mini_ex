#### Short introduction:
This Project is a little bit more than the usual throbber. It is not only a clockwise spinning watch with the arrows going the opposite direction (counterclockwise). Because the watch is spinning faster than the arrows are moving it will occur to the viewer as if the arrows are turning along with the watch, but The truth is they don't - they are fighting without succes.
Along with the spinning watch there are 10 inspirational (perhaps) quotes through variyng times, the first quote from the movie "The Prestige" and the rest handpicked from this website: https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/time
Enjoy!

#### Thoughts on the subject of thobbers and time:
As my throbber suggests, things are not always as they seem, especially when the whole context isn't shown. Behind the constant 'stream' that a throbber ensures, the truth is a little bit different. In our digital culture, we exspect a constant stream of data to be present. And even when our hardware and software fails to deliver this constancy, our dear throbbers have a tendancy to hide the feedback to the process that's really happening. We can only wait while our society continues to move on without us. People become doubtfull and impatient because they don't have any time to waste. When time is such an important measurement, why do throbbers not have a loading bar? Maybe we don't need an answer to everything and maybe the ability to enjoy the indeterminable breaks in life is a good and healthy quality to have. That way, terms such as 'boredom' and 'timewaste' gets a whole other perspective.

>"But as I argue in my book, Waiting for Word, we are looking at waiting entirely wrong. Waiting isnâ€™t essentially a wasted in-between time; instead waiting is a core part of messages we send each other across the fiber optic lines. The time it takes to receive and interpret a message is also part of its content. We take the moment of waiting and give it meaning; it becomes a message of its own."

#### My coding process: 

Ironically, I feel like I didn't have had the time to make this project the way it was meant to be. E.g I wanted to make the text scale for the size of the window so the whole text would always be visible. 
I also encountered some problems with the lenght of an 'array' as the console said it was undefined and therefore needed to use the exact number of total elements everytime I added another element to the array.

In the beginning I wanted to make a throbber as Donald Trumps hair orbiting his head which seemed a bit complicated in terms of photoshopping skills. I actually thought of lots of things but ended up with a watch - reasonably time related. 

I used [rotate()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/rotate) on all the shapes and used [push()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/push) and [pop()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/pop) to make the difference in color and speeds. To show the text I made an array with all the quotes as elements which got triggered by a counter.
