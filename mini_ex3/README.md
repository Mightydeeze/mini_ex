#### Short introduction:
This Project is a little bit more than the usual throbber. It is not only a clockwise spinning watch with the arrows going the opposite direction (counterclockwise). Because the watch is spinning faster than the arrows are moving it will occur to the viewer as if the arrows are turning along with the watch, but The truth is they don't - they are fighting without succes.
Along with the spinning watch there are 10 inspirational (perhaps) quotes through variyng times, the first quote from the movie "The Prestige" and the rest handpicked from this website: https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/time
Enjoy!

#### Thoughts on the subject of thobbers and time: (in progress)
As my throbber suggests, things are not always as they seem, especially when the whole context isn't shown. Behind the constant 'stream' that a throbber ensures, the truth is a little bit different. In our digital culture, we exspect a constant stream of data to be present. And even when our hardware and software fails to deliver this constancy, our dear throbbers have a tendancy to hide the feedback to the process that's really happening. We can only wait while our society continues to move on without us. People become doubtfull and impatient because they don't have any time to waste. When time is such an important measurement, why do throbbers not have a loading bar? Maybe we don't need an answer to everything and maybe the ability to enjoy the indeterminable breaks in life is a good and healthy quality to have. That way, terms such as 'boredom' and 'timewaste' gets a whole other perspective.

"But as I argue in my book, Waiting for Word, we are looking at waiting entirely wrong. Waiting isnâ€™t essentially a wasted in-between time; instead waiting is a core part of messages we send each other across the fiber optic lines. The time it takes to receive and interpret a message is also part of its content. We take the moment of waiting and give it meaning; it becomes a message of its own."

#### My coding process: (in progress)

Ironically, I feel like I didn't have the time to make the project the way that I wanted it to be.

Technically in the design

What is the time-related syntax/function that you have used in your program? and why you use in this way?
