"But as I argue in my book, Waiting for Word, we are looking at waiting entirely wrong. Waiting isnâ€™t essentially a wasted in-between time; instead waiting is a core part of messages we send each other across the fiber optic lines. The time it takes to receive and interpret a message is also part of its content. We take the moment of waiting and give it meaning; it becomes a message of its own."

Ironically, I feel like I didn't have the time to make the project the way that I wanted it to be.

Describe about your throbber design, both conceptually and technically.
What is the time-related syntax/function that you have used in your program? and why you use in this way?
Think about a throbber that you have encounted in digital culture e.g streaming video on YouTube or loading latest feeds on Facebook or waiting ticket transaction, what do you think a throbber tells us, or hide, about?
