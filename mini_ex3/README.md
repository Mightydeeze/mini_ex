#### Short introduction:
This Project is a little bit more than the usual throbber. It is not only a clockwise spinning watch with the arrows going the opposite direction (counterclockwise). Because the watch is spinning faster than the arrows are moving it will occur to the viewer as if the arrows are turning along with the watch, but The truth is they don't - they are resisting without succes.
Along with the spinning watch there are some (perhaps) inspirational quotes through variyng times, the first quote from the movie "The Prestige" and the rest handpicked from this website: https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/time
Enjoy!

"But as I argue in my book, Waiting for Word, we are looking at waiting entirely wrong. Waiting isnâ€™t essentially a wasted in-between time; instead waiting is a core part of messages we send each other across the fiber optic lines. The time it takes to receive and interpret a message is also part of its content. We take the moment of waiting and give it meaning; it becomes a message of its own."

Ironically, I feel like I didn't have the time to make the project the way that I wanted it to be.

Describe about your throbber design, both conceptually and technically.

What is the time-related syntax/function that you have used in your program? and why you use in this way?

Think about a throbber that you have encounted in digital culture e.g streaming video on YouTube or loading latest feeds on Facebook or waiting ticket transaction, what do you think a throbber tells us, or hide, about?
