#### Short introduction:
The following project is an attempt to visualize an interpretation of the fear of being watched by others online. Although we cannot see it, we might be under surveillance and our data is leaking - Are we going to pay the price for all our sins? In this particular case you will!

The program doesn't need a microphone or webcam to run as it only relies on the use of the mouse. **The main events happen with the mouse clicks. However, please try to search around the canvas before clicking to get the best experience :)** Enjoy!
