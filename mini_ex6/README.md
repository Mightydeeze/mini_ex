## babble_mouth by Frederik Ditlev Christensen
#### Screenshot of mini_ex6:

#### Short introduction:
This program is a colorful combination of an everchanging ellipse on an orange rectangle along with different pairs of words underneath. 
The quick movements in the shapes looks almost as a rapidly speaking mouth that babbles alot - the text should help underlining this.

The program has no audio - although I think it would be cool with a real babble!

Enjoy!

#
#### Generativity (in progress):
the "words" are not just words but the 50 most used english verbs, according to this website: https://www.ef.com/english-resources/english-vocabulary/top-50-verbs/. In my program, the verbs are pared with 7 pronouns in random compositions which means there are 350 different pairs as 7 times 50 is equal to 350 - a huge number if you ask me - which means that you have to be lucky to get the same combination of pronoun and verb.

to a certain extent where the words get overused and lose their meaning
