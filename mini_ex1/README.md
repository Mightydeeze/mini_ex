## Alternative Abstract Solarsystem by Frederik Ditlev Christensen

#### Short introduction:
The following project is a virtual representation of floating spheres in an open space. It might look to you as a solar system of some kind - in this case my work has succeeded. The spheres are comepletely still while the camera is moving slowly in a sinus curve which makes it seem like the spheres are moving although they are not.

#### My code process:
This coding process has been my first of many to come, and because of this I didn't really structurerize my steps from the beginning till the end as I did not know much about the possibilities of **P5.js** at this state. In the beginning I was just fascinated by the idea of working with 3D modelling in a webbrowser which led the to end result. In the beginning I searched the internet for car models in the format of objects (**obj.**) as this format is understandable by **p5.js**. Unfortunately I had a tough time finding cars so I decided to use more common shapes that would not need to be imported. 
#
#### The steps in making the program (sort of):
My next thought became to make a fully functional solar system with planets in orbit, but I simply couldn't find the right formulars so I came up with other alternatives. 

1. First I made a canvas in 3D like so: **createCanvas(1600,1000,WEBGL)**

2. Next I copied the function **['perspective()'](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/perspective)** from **p5js.org**, changed the boxes into spheres and modified the numbers to make more rows and bigger spaces between them. 

3. Then I deleted the **'OrbitControl();'** because I didn't want the viewer to control the angle of perspective.

4. To move the camera I made use of the function **['camera()'](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/camera)** with different numbers that made the camera travel further and with a slower speed. 

5. I gave color to the Spheres with the function **['color()'](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/color)** and the background.

6. I made a bigger sphere as a sun and gave it color as well.

#### Coding compared to reading and writing text:
Along with other languages, When it comes to coding as a language it takes practise to master or to at least understand it. Coding can be understood both by people and computers as a language in between languages, as computers don't know english and people may have a hard time reading ones and zeros. When I used the coding in my project, I understood the things better when I wrote it myself in opposition to the parts I just copied. Likewise my understanding grew when comparing the visual differences in my program with the changes I made in my code. This way of leaning can be a big potential in order to learn the practise of code.
