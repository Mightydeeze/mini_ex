#### What is the Program?

**The following text is not complete**

When you first boot up the program **“You Light Up the Room”** you are, ironically, faced with a black screen. There are no signifers to tell you what to do, nor are there any prompts, sounds, or any visible features. The screen will remain black until you click the screen, after which the text “You light up the room” will appear in the center and a female voice will read the message aloud. Music will start to play and colored circles will begin floating in from the right side of the canvas, keeping to the background. 

If you continue to click, another message will pop up. The tone of the written text is encouraging and happy, giving you motivational compliments as you cycle through them. At first, the program seems innocent enough as it will continue to cycle through a defined set of kind phrases. It is only if you get impatient and start to click through the text rapidly that the program will change. It will stop praising and instead become more and more frustrated with its inability to give you what you need. 

Should you keep clicking rapidly, the program will eventually “crash,” leaving you with a black screen and an “Error” message. The music will stop and the circles moving in the background will disappear. After this, there is no way to restart the program other than to refresh the page and start over.

Code Collaboration
This project was the collaborative effort of [Alexander Svanholm](https://github.com/ubiquitousman/mini-ex), [Anne Gregersen](https://github.com/AnnesFlashBack/Mini-Exercises), and [Frederik Ditlev](https://github.com/Mightydeeze/mini_ex/tree/mini_ex_main). We spent a good amount of time spitballing ideas and thinking of possible angles of attack in the beginning of the process, ending on the idea of a bot reading compliments to the user. The sinister turn, as well as the error message, the background graphics, and the music all came organically as we worked and thought of different ideas we could implement. 

The moving graphics was a last minute addition. We didn’t much like the static, flat black of the background and wanted to incorporate something more visually interesting to stimulate the viewing experience. We knew it couldn’t be too distracting since that would take away from the main focus that was the text. 

We tried to incorporate what we had learned of **JSON** files into the project as well. Since we had the large arrays of text it seemed like an ideal choice, but we simply couldn’t get it to work. At the time, we were nearing the completion of the program and changing everything up so that the **JSON** file might work seemed like to big of an endeavor. Instead, we moved the text arrays into their own .js file so the code didn’t look so chaotic.
