# Flowcharts

### The Escape Room

You are trapped inside a room and must try to figure out how to escape before the time runs out. The player needs to solve puzzles in order to get out. These puzzles can involve ciphers, finding hidden objects, filling out crosswords, matching patterns, etc..

Potential physical components of the game: Hidden doors, locked doors, locks, keys, multiple rooms.

A possible challenge for this idea might be the gathering of all the data we need, as we need to gather all the information and pictures ourselves. It will be very time consuming and require quite a bit of coordination (It would be silly to start the photoshoot before we knew what would actually be relevant to the program).

### Platform Sidescroller

You are in control of a small, simple, vehicle that is driving along the road. Throughout, obstacles will appear and hitting them will crash your car. If you can successfully avoid all the obstacles and get to the end of the level, you win and may be allowed to go on to the next stage.

With this program, a challenge we could encounter is the difficulty in communicating the controls to the user. We thought of this program as a way to explore a userâ€™s innate understanding of basic control schemes found in video games, and a technical challenge for this would be to adequately communicate the limited functions of the game to the user without using blocks of text.

#### Individual Analysis:

I have chosen to make a flowchart to describe miniEx_8 (the one concerning API's), as it in my opinion is the most complex exercise we have done so far.

In relation to the other flowcharts, this one is more technical as it describes some of the processes that happens in the the coding. In addiion to this, the flowchart is made after the program was made. The others were made during the thinking phase (brainstorming) of two games that don't exist yet.

When you lookat flowcharts in the perspective of algorithms, it's clear to say that the logic and the way of thinking in relation to algorithms gets reflected in the flowcharts. In this way of thinking, the algorithms can be seen as a series of steps to be executed in certain cases under the right conditions. Because of this, it's important to know the current state in order to know which action to manage. In a flow chart every step along with the states are written down and sort of getting layed out as a path to follow (similar to a recipe). As computational algorithms operate on logic an usually happens very fast and in huge numbers, it can sometimes be a good idea to map out some of the steps in groups to make it more manageable to humans. And flowcharts are an excellent example of doing so.
